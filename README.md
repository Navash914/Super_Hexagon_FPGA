# Super_Hexagon_FPGA
An implementation of the game "Super Hexagon" using C to program a DE1-SoC board

The objective of the game is to move the player around the central hexagon to avoid collision with the incoming hexagons by navigating the player through the gaps.

Game difficulty is increased by allowing the incoming hexagons as well as the game screen to rotate.
